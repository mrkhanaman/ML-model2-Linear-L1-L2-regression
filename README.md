In this Predictive Model to estimate House prices based on the Training data (train.csv) and Test data (test.csv).

 a. Data Exploration:
      - Load and examine the dataset.
      - Tackle missing values, handle outliers, and clean up the data properly.
        
 b. Feature Engineering or Normalization:
      - Convert any categorical data into numerical values.
      - Create new features from the existing data if required.

 c. Modelling:
      - Train different models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
      - Compare their performance and choose the one that works best.

 d. Predictions:
      * Finally, use the best-performing model to make predictions on the test data.

 e. Evaluation:
      * Use the right metrics to assess the model's performance, such as RMSE or MAE.

Developing model Summary:

Step 1. Clean the dataset of Train.csv and export the cleaned dataset as cleaned_Train.csv

Step 2. Create spliting training and testing data on cleaned_train.csv

Step 3. Clean the dataset of Test.csv and export the cleaned dataset as cleaned_train.csv

Step 4. Load the Training and Test Datasets.
               * Training dataset = cleaned_Tain.csv
               * Testing dataset = cleaned_Test.csv

Step 5. Train Models:
               * Linear Regression
               * Lasso Regression
               * Ridge Regression
